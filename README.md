# OOPDEFORGNUOCTAVE

OOPDE for the Finite Element Method (FEM) project developed for GNU Octave. This project encompasses a comprehensive framework for computational engineering, showcasing advancements in geometry generation, adaptive mesh refinement algorithms, finite element method (FEM) models, error handling,validation, and dissemination efforts. Utilizing libraries such as distmesh2d, polygongeometry, and freegeometry, the framework enables flexible and efficient geometry creation. The integration of an innovative adaptive mesh refinement algorithm enhances computational performance and accuracy in FEM models, exemplified by implementations of Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions and Stokesâ€™ law equations. Robust error handling techniques mitigate the absence of standard error classes in Octave. Rigorous validation procedures ensure the reliability of the framework, validated against analytical solutions and benchmarked against existing software. Comprehensive documentation and dissemination efforts aim to facilitate widespread adoption and collaboration in the computational engineering community, underscoring the versatility, efficiency, and robustness of the OOPDE FEM framework for GNU Octave.


Run files are provided in both folders of myOctave and MATLAB, and both are compatible for MATLAB and Octave. User can modify the initial values and parameters accordingly, and can choose different classes for grid generations and different classes from pde class. Also they can make their own pdes according to their problem/scenario and solve it.
