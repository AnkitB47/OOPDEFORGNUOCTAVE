LShape vs Lshape 

Lshape is a class that defines an L-shaped 
geometry. It has 6 boundary segments.

The class LShape is derived from Lshape, 
but redefines the boundary segment numbers. 
It has only two boundary segments.

Note that LShape needs the hmax argument.
An empty constructor call is not possible.
This is a Matlab issue.
